# 🏗️ PropStack Challenge: Build a Real Estate Tech Explorer

Welcome to the **PropStack Challenge** — a real-world coding competition to help us discover talented developers and showcase their skills in the world of real estate technology (PropTech).

---

## 💡 The Challenge

Build a full-stack web application that visually maps out the technology companies used in the **Multifamily** real estate industry. Think of it like [StackShare.io](https://stackshare.io/stacks), but specifically designed for real estate asset classes.

Your app should let users explore:
- 📂 **Multifamily → Area** (Pre-Occupancy, Occupancy, Post-Occupancy)  
- 🧩 **Area → Segment** (e.g., Discovery, Move-In, Lease Management)  
- 🗂️ **Segment → Sub-category** (e.g., CRMs, Tenant Tech Packages, Access Control)  
- 🏢 **Sub-category → Tech stack** (company name, logo, and URL)
